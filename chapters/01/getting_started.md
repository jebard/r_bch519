# The R Programming Language

* R is a programming language originally developed in 1993 for statistical analysis.
* R is an interpreted language, meaning that there is no need for compiling, just like python.
* R is considered a functional language (Declarative programming), meaning that most code centers on executing functions.
  * Program logic is dictated by function executions rather than algorithm flow.
  * Imperative Approaches (java, python, perl, C) focus more on loops, conditionals.
  * Each function is designed to do a specific task like sum(), average(), log()

## RStudio

* RStudio is an integrated development enviornment (IDE) for R. Similar to Jupyter Notebooks, Eclipse, PyCharm...
  * RStudio is layered ontop of the underlying R programming language.
  * Desktop versions are available, as well as on CCR OnDemand.
