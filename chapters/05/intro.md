# Data Input and Output
Bioinformatics is a field of big datasets. Fortunately for us, by the time data is being imported into R for analysis, it has been substantially processed on the command line.
For example, illumina sequencers can produce billions of sequences, which can be reduced to a simple gene x sample matrix as in the case of RNA-Sequencing. Here we will go over the code needed to load in data from matrix files and do some initial processing.
