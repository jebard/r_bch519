# Welcome to the introductory to programming in R! 
## Eric Pitman Summer Workshop in Computational Science
The objective of this tutorial  is to establish fundamental skills in the R programming language through
the use of real-life next-generation sequencing datasets. We will cover the basics of the R programming language,
including using the RStudio interfaces, learn package installations, plot generation, amongst other things.
